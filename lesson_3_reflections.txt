When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate with other people, or if you want your code to be open source.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If other people change the code in that branch, you might not want those changes on your computer. If it automatically updated then you would get changes that you might not want. 



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch takes a commit from your original branch and allows you to alter the programme and make new commits without altering the original branch. 
A clone copies a respoitory to your local computer
A fork is a clone from one GitHub user account to another, and keeps track of where the repository came from and where it is going to.  



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to see any new changes to the remote file while working offline.



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without using GitHub, collaboration would be much harder. Each person would have to e.g. upload a zip file with their current version and someone would need to check the differences. With GitHub it's easier to upload changes from the master branch, putting your changes in another branch, and asking people to check your code before merging it into the main copy. This allows people to test and check your changes, and let know know if they have any suggestions.
