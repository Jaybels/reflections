What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates a place for git to store versions (commits) of your files. You need to do this so that you have someone to commit versions to. 



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where you put the files you wish to commit, while the repository holds commited versions/files and the working directory has the current commit. It add value are you can check to make sure all files you wish to commit are there, and you haven't made a mistake, before you commit.
